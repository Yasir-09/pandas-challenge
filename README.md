# DESCRIPTION
Two datasets (csv files) were provided that contained data about 15 different schools and another that contains 39,170 different students’ data with their math and reading scores. The task was to combine these two datasets and analyse high level summaries of the data (i.e., total budgets, total students, passing rates) to a more in-depth summary analysis (i.e., passing rates by school, passing rates by size, average spending on students etc.).


# # SUMMARY FINDINGS

1.	District Summary Analysis: The summary analysis provides a descriptive information of key metrics for the entire district. The analysis includes the following information:
o	Total number of unique schools: 15
o	Total number of students: 39170
o	Total budget: $24,649,428
o	Average math score: 78.98
o	Average reading score: 81.87
o	Percentage of students passing math: 74.98
o	Percentage of students passing reading: 85.80
o	Percentage of students overall passing (passing both math and reading): 65.17

This data provides an overview of the district's educational performance and resource allocation, highlighting the average scores for two subjects and the percentage of students passing the test for math and reading subject.

2.	School Summary Analysis:  The summary analysis provides a descriptive information of key metrics about each school within the district. The analysis includes the following information for each school:
o	School type= District or Charter
o	Total number of students per school:
1.	Bailey High School       4976
2.	Cabrera High School      1858
3.	Figueroa High School     2949
4.	Ford High School         2739
5.	Griffin High School      1468
6.	Hernandez High School    4635
7.	Holden High School        427
8.	Huang High School        2917
9.	Johnson High School      4761
10.	Pena High School          962
11.	Rodriguez High School    3999
12.	Shelton High School      1761
13.	Thomas High School       1635
14.	Wilson High School       2283
15.	Wright High School       1800
o	Total school budget
o	Per student budget spending
o	Number of schools with math scores greater than 70
o	Number of schools with reading scores greater than 70
o	Number of students per school that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher.
o	Math, reading and overall passing rates.

This data allows for a detailed comparison of different schools within the district as per budget spending and average scores in maths and reading subject. Therefore, an insight into the academic performance of each school is possible, compared to the resource allocation.

#Conclusion: The district summary and school summary analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the district's overall performance and the performance of individual schools. By examining key metrics such as average scores and the percentage of students passing math and reading, educators and administrators can identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, curriculum development, and instructional strategies.Following three conclusions were drawn:
1.	Schools having higher budgets revealed lower scores, and vice-versa. Further, budget spent per student has no do direct relation with better performance of a student academically.
2.	Size of school did impact the academic performance of the students. The percentage of students passing drops as school size keeps getting bigger. Ideal size of the school is Medium (1000-2000).	
3.	Overall, passing rate of charter schools was better than district type schools.  This is evident by looking the charter type schools have better averages and passing rates than that of district type schools. Further, most of the bottom performing schools were district type. 

#Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:
1.	Identify schools with lower average scores and lower percentages of students passing math and reading. These schools may require additional support and interventions to improve academic performance.
2.	Reduce the school size which are categories as large schools with over 2000-5000 students. As the academic performance is significantly and this could be attributed to heavy load on teachers, teaching strategies being ineffective or less attention to so many students.
3.	Try to observe and analyse the Charter schools’ teaching methods and curriculum effectiveness as they have higher percentages of students passing math and reading and overall. This will help identifying the best practices that can be replicated in other schools of the district to improve performance.
